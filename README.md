# Hyperbolic-Graph-Generator

A port of [Hyperbolic-Graph-Generator](https://github.com/named-data/Hyperbolic-Graph-Generator) to the Rust programming language for my own experiments.

The program generates a graph that describes the geometric coordinates and the links of a hyperbolic graph compatible with the parameters provided by the user. The program generates random hyperbolic graphs according to the models in: http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.82.036106

A description of how the hyperbolic graph generator works can be found at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05180

TODO:
- make into a proper crate
- add c bindings
